TLBINF32.DLL Notes For Use With ComAddInInstaller.xls Workbook
--------------------------------------------------------------

The TLBINF32.DLL (TypeLib Info) file is a Microsoft-provided file that allows you
to write code that reads type-library files, files where the definitions
of COM objects are stored. 

The ComAddInInstaller.xls workbook uses TLBINF32.DLL to retrieve the creatable objects
and their ProgIDs from your COM Add-In DLL file. This is done to ensure that you are
installing the write ProgID in the System Registry.

If you already have TLBINF32.DLL on your system, no action is required. 

If you do not have TLBINF32.DLL on your system, you will need to install it, 
register it with Windows, and set a reference in the ComAddInInstaller.xls VBProject
to that library. This file contains instructions to do this.

1) Copy the TLBINF32.DLL file from this folder to "C:\Windows\System32"

2) Close all applications.

3) Go to the Windows Start Menu, choose Run, and enter
	RegSvr32 C:\Windows\System32\TLBINF32.DLL
and click OK. You should receive a message box indicating success.

4) Open the ComAddInInstaller.xls workbook in Excel and open the VBA project. 

5) Go to the Tools menu, choose References. You may see "TypeLib Information" marked as MISSING. If so, 
uncheck that Reference Item. 

6) In the References dialog, click the Browse button, navigate to "C:\Windows\System32" and select and open
"TLBINF32.DLL"

7) Save the ComAddInInstaller.xls workbook.
